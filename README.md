# NorthWind_VB

This project is a simple CRUD web application that uses Microsoft ASP.NET framework 4.7 web forms, Visual Basic.NET, Entity Framework, Twitter Bootstrap, and SQL Server with a copy of the Northwind database from Microsoft.
I used AI (Prome AI) to help me make the logo and write (Chat GPT) the main page.

I still have some work I want to do, but I'm off to a pretty good start.
